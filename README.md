Galway Charity Prjects(GCP) - A home for Galway's volunteering community to come together to support local charities. 
</h2>
<div align="center"> 

Before Covid-19 people, interested in volunteering, would often look beyond their own county and even country for volunteering oppotunities.  The recent times have taught us all how powerful the impact can be when we support local. 
Today, some charities are struggling because they cannot get access to volunteers to support their projects and some volunteers are lost as they don't know what projects they can support in their area. 
[Galway Charity Projects](https://galway-charity-projects.herokuapp.com/) is a place to encourage local volunteers and charities to engage more and work together to strengthen our community
<br>
Features of the site include easy to view project list and detail page and simple registration process for charities which I hope will allow users to achieve the following: 

* Allow *charities* to register their project
* Enable *volunteers* to search live projects in their area and get in touch with the charity to find out more. 
* *Project Detail Page - Select a project,* they should see the instructions, any downloadable files, and a contact for the charity.
<br>
In Phase one we are focusing on the city of Galway with the intention to build on this for all the cities and towns in Ireland to encourage people to learn more about the volunteering opportunities close to home.

## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of We Support Local (WSL) is to provide a clean, intuitive and engaging site to help people find out more about the businesses close to them - those with and without store fronts. 

WSL has two target audiences: Business Owners and the local community looking to support. 

#### Business Owner goals

Business Owners want and need support during covid: 
- They want to get their message out there that they are open and back for business
- They want to make sure the community is aware they are open
- They want to share their stories in the weekly WSL newsletter 
- They want an easy way to register their business online

WSL can help business owners because:
- It provides a platform for business owners to share their story
- It ensures their listing is live and active on the site
- Business owners can easily submit their business for the site using a simple sign up form
- WSL also offers a direct link from google maps to the business to ansure customers know where they are located. 


#### Local Community goals

During these carazy times people want to make the extra effort to shop local and support local where they can. 
Sometimes they might not always be aware of the different shops and stores in their area. 

Members of the local community goals are:
- Find out if there is a local shop or service they can avail of
- Learn about new businesses in their area
- Locate where in the city shops and services are located
- Have a one stop location where they can find out all about the local businesses 

WSL can help meet the needs of the community because: 
- It can offer a weekly digest via newsletter to keep them informed on the latest updates in their area. 
- It displays in an engaging and simple way the location and ratings of various businesses that might be of interest to them. 
- It has been designed with user experience as a priority to easily guide them through the site 

#### Developer and Business Goals

- A well designed directory of businesses that strives to have a positive imact on the community. 
- Good and clean programming that is robust and scaleable with the increase of cities and businesses joining. 
- A professional looking first attempt of using JavaScript and apis -  google maps and emailJS which the developer is excited to make a part of her portfolio. 

#### User Stories

As a business owner, I want:
1. To register my business
2. Review other businesses in my area
3. Collaborate with WSL in their weekly newsletter to share my story with the community. 


As a member of the community, I want:
1. Discover more about the businesses in my area based on my catagories of interest
2. A visually and operationally appealing site that makes if simple to learn more about local shops and services 
    - modifications to the UX have been built in to support the expereince such as a "Back to TOp" button on the listing page. 
3. Sign up to a newsletter to get more updates on the different businesses reopening and the progress they are making

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the site is one that is visually appealing and simple to follow. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

**Fonts**

- The primary font **Oswald** was chosen because it is a crisp, sharp and easy to read font. It was inspired byt the logo created on Canva.com. 

**Colours**

- The primary colour choices for this site is grey and yellow. Again this has been inspired but the Logo created on Canva.com. A basica pallet was chosen to ensure the infomration on the page was the main focus.

**Styling**

- On the listing page cards and containers have been given rounded edges and a drop shadow to highlight these areas on the page more.  
- Design and styting consistency was important on this site to help linking and combining the related areas together. 


**City Tile Images**

- Images of iconic city landmarks were chosen to help a user quickly identify the location.  


**Catagory Tile Images**

- The catagory images were chosen to help identify the catagory to the user, selecting common imagery often associated to each topic. 


**Hero Banner images**

- To maintain consistency the hero banner images were chosen to mimic the catagory tiles where possible. 
- The homepage image was chosen for its friendliness and warmness of complimentry colour palette. 



### Wireframes

During the early part of the project wireframes were created using pen and paper and on [Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/).
